        <h2>How To Make Coconut Rice </h2>

        <p>I started cooking from a very early age and i've come to love it as it helps me de-stress. Coconut rice is my best food, and I will take you through a step by step process of how to make that below.</p>
        
        <h2 class="underline">Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>If you're using fresh coconuts, crack it open and separate the softer inner part from the hard shell using a small knife.</li>
            <li>Chop the coconuts into tiny bits and then put it in a blender with a few cups of warm water. Blend for about 6 min.</li>
            <li>Pour the contents of the blender into a small sieve and drain the milk. Apply pressure to make sure you squeeze all the milk out. You can add more warm water to the coconut shaft and drain again.</li>
            <li>Next, parboil your rice by cooking for about 10 min., then take it off the cooker and run cold water through it. Repeat until the rice cools down. Now place in a colander and drain. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat a pot and add coconut oil to help intensify the flavour. Add onion, chopped pepper, ginger, garlic and all the spices (except crayfish). Sauté for 5 min.</li>
            <li>Add your pre-made coconut milk and parboiled rice, and then add the chicken stock. Cook for 15–20 min. Make sure you have enough coconut milk so that you can add more to the rice if it dries out.</li>
            <li>Once the rice is almost done, add the crayfish. Mix it together and allow to simmer.</li>
        </ol>
